0.4 = 61
-1.0 = 16
1.1 = 239
1.7 = 238
0.8 = 1
-2.1 = 1
-0.4 = 18

Possible Ways to reduce 1x1:

1. Focus only on the base pairs for the loop, as given the ibp and cbp the values do not change with unpaired bases much.
2. focus only on closing base pair, as parameters for a specific closing base pair are very similar. We can use normal distribution with mean = highest frequency , and a small std dev.
3. Focus only on values with 1.1 & 1.7 kcal/mol as they constitute the bulk of the params.
